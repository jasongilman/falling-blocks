# falling-blocks

A skeleton project for building a Tetris clone. This uses a fork of the [Bocko](https://github.com/mfikes/bocko) library called [Bocko Fun](https://github.com/jasongilman/bocko-fun).

## Implementing the Game

TODO

  * game loop, board displayed, one piece implemented. It falls and you can move and rotate it.
* Look for TODOs

## Startup

Run `lein repl` in the project directory

Then run `(reset)` in the repl. A swing window will open and the game will start.
